# POSH-ProGet-API
A PowerShell module for working with Inedo's ProGet API. 
Currently, this is primarily for working nuget feeds.

It requires PowerShell v3 or higher.

It has a dependency on nuget.exe, so a copy has been included.

The module contains the following functions:

   * Copy-PackageToFeed
   * Get-FeedID
   * Get-FeedList
   * Get-Latest
   * Get-LatestPackageVersion
   * Get-Package
   * Remove-PackageVersionFromFeed
   * Test-PackageIsInFeed
   * Test-PackageVersionIsInFeed
